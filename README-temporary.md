## start

As for the front-end project, it does not require as complicated configuration as the back-end and can be run directly.

The only one thing is that I modified the run script in `package.json` as you can see.

Because I found some issues that couldn't be solved when building with yarn, I used npm. But I think you can use yarn if you like.
